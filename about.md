<p>I&#8217;m <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eiTakp4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a scientist</a> (machine learning, personalization &amp; information retrieval) and a startup person. I currently lead science at <a href="https://cnn.com">CNN</a>, focusing for now on news personalization and related ethical issues. Previously, I was founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://canopy.cr/">Canopy</a>, focusing on privacy and personalization. Canopy was acquired by CNN in March 2020. Before that, I was the co-founder &amp; CTO of music intelligence company <A href="/2015/07/14/10-years/">The Echo Nest</A>, sold to Spotify in 2014, where I was Principal Scientist until 2016. At Spotify I helped build their <a href="https://research.atspotify.com">research team</a> and focused on <a href="/2015/07/31/fresh-finds/">discovery of brand new music</a>. 

<p>I was an <a href="/2009/11/30/a-singular-christmas-2004/">artist / musician</a> (ex-&#8220;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/bwhitman">Blitter</a>&#8220;) from the late 90s through mid-00s. I work on many hardware &amp; software side projects, mostly centered around music, speech and machine learning. I am currently developing a <a href="https://github.com/bwhitman/alles">distributed mesh music synthesizer</a> and a portable creative computing platform.</p>

<p>I received an MS in computer science, focusing on natural language processing, from Columbia University, then a PhD in machine learning and music understanding at MIT.</p>

<p>I live both in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadra_Island">Quadra Island</a>, BC, Canada. </p>
