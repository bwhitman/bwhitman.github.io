<p>I&#8217;m <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eiTakp4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a scientist</a> (machine learning, personalization &amp; information retrieval) and a startup person. As of early 2023, I'm currently just beginning work on a new startup. 

<P>I was Chief Scientist at <a href="https://cnn.com">CNN</a> until early 2022, working on news personalization and related ethical issues. I joined via their acqusition of my startup, <a href="https://notes.variogram.com/2022/08/01/the-story-of-canopy/">Canopy</a>, where we built a new fully private and explainable personalization stack. 

<P>Before that, I was the co-founder &amp; CTO of music intelligence company <A href="/2015/07/14/10-years/">The Echo Nest</A>, sold to Spotify in 2014, where I was Principal Scientist until 2016. At Spotify I helped build their <a href="https://research.atspotify.com">research team</a> and focused on <a href="/2015/07/31/fresh-finds/">discovery of brand new music</a>. 

<p>I was an <a href="/2009/11/30/a-singular-christmas-2004/">artist / musician</a> (ex-&#8220;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/bwhitman">Blitter</a>&#8220;) from the late 90s through mid-00s. I work on many hardware &amp; software side projects, mostly centered around music, speech and machine learning. I am currently developing a <a href="https://notes.variogram.com/2022/09/23/alles-amy/">distributed mesh music synthesizer called Alles</a> and a <a href="https://notes.variogram.com/2023/02/14/tulip/">portable creative computing platform called Tulip.</a></p>

<p>I received an MS in computer science at the Natural Language Processing group at Columbia University, then a PhD in machine learning and music understanding at MIT.</p>

<p>I live both in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadra_Island">Quadra Island</a>, BC, Canada. </p>
