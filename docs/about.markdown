I’m a scientist (machine learning, music understanding, recommendation, information retrieval) and a startup person. I was the co-founder & CTO of the Echo Nest, sold to Spotify, where I was Principal Scientist for a few years until 2016, mostly focusing on discovery of brand new music. I was then founder & CEO of Canopy, focusing on privacy and personalization. Canopy was acquired by CNN in March 2020; I'm their Chief Scientist, focusing on news personalization and some other neat upcoming things.

I was an artist / musician (ex-“Blitter“) from the late 90s through mid-00s, I still work on small music projects from time to time. I work on many hardware side projects, mostly centered around audio, speech and machine learning. I am currently developing a distributed mesh music synthesizer and a portable creative computing platform.

I received a masters degree in computer science focusing on natural language processing from Columbia University in 2000, then a PhD in machine learning and music understanding at the MIT Media Lab in 2005.

I live in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and Quadra Island, BC, Canada.
