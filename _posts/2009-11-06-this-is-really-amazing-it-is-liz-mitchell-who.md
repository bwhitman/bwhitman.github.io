This is really amazing. It is Liz Mitchell (who later went on to be the lead singer of “Boney M” of all things) doing the classic “Motherless Child” on what looks to be a German pop TV programme in the early 70s. But the video appears to be an “amateur [kinescope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinescope)” that looks strangely digital, with frame cuts and tracking issues. The timing and quality is way off for this to be an actual kinescope, but maybe someone in Germany recorded this with a film camera pointed at their TV? Fits the music beautifully.
