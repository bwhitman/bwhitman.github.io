<p class="small">Urcella and I trying to figure out a name for the company, late 2017. Way ahead on the Elon curve!</p>

A few months ago, I left CNN at my two year mark following [their acquistion of my company, the Canopy Crest Corporation, aka Canopy.](https://notes.variogram.com/2020/04/07/canopy-is-joining-cnn/) Canopy lives on in some surprising ways.

Canopy was at heart an issue driven start up, motivated to do real people in the world good. Everything we created at Canopy was a success. We put together an astounding team, the best I've ever worked with. We took a complicated technology to the market and ultimately into the hands of tens of millions. We built a leading-edge consumer application that had dear fans and gained wide influence. We sold it to the world's biggest news brand, at a time when being careful about the news had never been more critical. We told a necessary story to the world. I'm proud of what we built as a startup, what we built at the acquirer, and most of all our team: our priorities and how we took care of each other.
