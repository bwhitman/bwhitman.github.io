I want to tell the world about a very fun side project thing I've been working on for years, on and off. I am not sure how many others will find it as engaging as I have, but I bet there's someone out there. My 3rd startup (more soon on that!) is starting to get busy and I know from experience I'll need to put down my soldering plate and copy of EAGLE soon. I thought I should share where I got to and hope that others can take care of it and help me make it even better. 

[I built a computer meant for being creative called Tulip Creative Computer](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/README.md). It's inspired by the 8- and 16-bit computers of my youth but with a lot of modern twists. It's a computer you can carry with you, with a keyboard, screen, battery. When you turn it on, you see a Python prompt, immediately. The "OS" of the computer itself is Python. It's not running something else with a shell on top. You write and execute programs on the device itself. You have access to the entire hardware: a dual core 240MHz CPU with 8MB RAM, a 2D GPU with hardware sprites and scrolling bitmap planes, a 1024x600 color display with touchscreen, Wi-Fi, a 32-voice sound synthesizer, stereo audio, hardware MIDI in and out (with very precise timing!), 8 or 32MB of storage.

You can build a Tulip yourself. Even if you don't have a lot of electronics experience! There are three ways to build a Tulip, in order of stability: [with a breadboard and a lot of hookup wires (no soldering!)](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/tulip_breadboard.md), [with a small $10 breakout PCB and off the shelf boards](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/tulip_breakout.md) (through-hole soldering only), or a [fully integrated board, like a Raspberry Pi but with everything you need for Tulip already on it](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/tulip_board.md). 

[You can also just download a (macOS for now) Tulip for your computer, running as a simulator](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/tulip_desktop.md), with all the same features (and limitations.) It's the same codebase as hardware Tulip but running in a window on your computer. It's a great way to give it a try.

Tulip comes with a built in text editor, and soon a music editor. If you connect to Wi-Fi you're able to join **T&nbsp;U&nbsp;L&nbsp;I&nbsp;P&nbsp;~&nbsp;W&nbsp;O&nbsp;R&nbsp;L&nbsp;D**, a Tulip-only chat room where you can share what you've made! You can also use Python sockets and urllib to access network resources, as well as use Tulip as a controller for [an Alles mesh.](http://alles.website) Instant surround sound! 

Tulip is for making things. I am sure many of you understand the draw of sitting at a device just for creativity -- think a drum machine, or a modular synthesizer, or a typewriter. Something that's personal to you with everything you need built in. Something where it's impossible (or at least very hard!) to see a web page or a tweet, or get a text. It can also be a great device to compose music, or write, or make video games or other creative software.

I've really enjoyed working on Tulip, especially the past few months as it all started coming together. I love carrying my Tulip somewhere and coming back an hour later with a new song, or neat little game, or some writing. It's a pleasure to use and the limitations of the hardware really do set up your mind to be creative. 

And the joy of working on Tulip itself should not be minimized! Putting pieces together from so much great scaffolding over the years of computer history to stand up a new kind of system is a particularly fun puzzle. [Getting USB key repeat going](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/ports/esp32s3/usb_keyboard.c#L303), or [optimizing the pipeline for scanline-based character drawing](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/extmod/tulip/display.c#L105), or [decoding ANSI escape messages](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/extmod/tulip/display.c#L474), or [getting the ESP32's GDMA to draw from faster RAM in pieces to support a bigger display](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/ports/esp32s3/components/bw_esp_lcd/src/esp_lcd_rgb_panel.c#L685) were particularly fun challenges that required a lot of help from other smart people and projects. If this speaks to you, please come join us and make Tulip even better. 

Please try it out -- [get the macOS app](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/tulip_desktop.md) or [buy the parts to build your own](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc#tulip-hardware-howtos) -- and I'd really welcome changes, new capabilities, and issues you're having. (Can someone make us a touchscreen sprite and tile editor for 2d games?) [I welcome issue or pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc/), and [my email for any other thoughts.](mailto:brian@variogram.com) See you on **T&nbsp;U&nbsp;L&nbsp;I&nbsp;P&nbsp;~&nbsp;W&nbsp;O&nbsp;R&nbsp;L&nbsp;D**, and have fun!

<p class='note'>Tulip would not be possible without the constant help and support from the group chat / soldering tip line of Dan Ellis and Douglas Repetto, and tons of help and early PCB designs by Matt Mets. Tulip's OS is based on the great MicroPython project, the ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS. Thanks also to all my friends who have heard nothing but Tulip status updates from me over the years.</p>
