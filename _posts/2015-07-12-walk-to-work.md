I recorded my walk to work on binaural microphones. You should hear it on headphones sometime, it’s strangely soothing.

I made this all with a (relatively) cheap kit: the [Tascam DR-05](http://tascam.com/product/dr-05/) recorder and a pair of [Soundman OKM II Studio Binaural Microphones](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Binaural-microphone-OKM-II-Rock-Studio-/220613362284). Soundman only appears to sell their microphones, new, on eBay, these days.

When you walk with these on you feel like a performance. You listen just as carefully as the microphones are. You move fluidly and try not to rustle, cough, or act aggressively. I walk this hour (including the 10 minute ferry ride) twice a day, whenever I’m in NYC during the week. Even if I never shared it, or deleted the WAV file immediately, I’d want to keep doing it this way.
