I’ll be at [the Music and Bits](http://musicandbits.com/program/) conference in Amsterdam next week that kicks off the excellent [Amsterdam Dance Event](http://www.amsterdam-dance-event.nl/). There’s talks all day on the 21st and also a [hack day](http://musichackday.org) that EN is supporting. I’ll be sharing the stage [with some serious players](http://musicandbits.com/program/): [Soundcloud](http://blog.soundcloud.com), [Justin from Muxtape](http://justinouellette.com/), RjDj, Last.fm, [VOLODKIN](http://fascinated.fm/) …

I’m most excited that [STEIM](http://steim.nl) will be there during the hack day: [I had a wonderful time there earlier this year](http://steim.org/projectblog/?p=532) and I now know where the best coffee places are, so I won’t waste any time looking.

I’ll post my talk when I get back.
