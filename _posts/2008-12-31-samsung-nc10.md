Good:

- Keyboard. Easy to type on. No real problems. 
- Weight/size. Is about exactly half the weight of a white macbook (when you include power adapters for both.) I didn’t think this would matter but it really does, especially when walking around a lot with it on you. 
- Battery. Hasn’t run out during a day yet.
- Does everything I do, python, web, logging into EC2 machines….
- Price. It was a gift, but still! At the very least I get a year of mobile use for $400 before Apple decides to put a keyboard on an iPod or whatever.

Bad:

- Trackpad. Is too sensitive, ubuntu doesn’t like it much. Clickers are on a rocker and the middle of it is not pushable. My thumb always wants to hit the middle of it. Have a bluetooth mouse to mitigate this.
- Comes with windows, Ubuntu was dead simple to install but is still lacking polishes I now find necessary. [Not sure I want to involve OSX yet](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/samsung-hc-10-h.html).
