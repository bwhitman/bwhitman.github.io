I had a lot of posts sitting in the old Wordpressy blog that is due for a huge SQL injection attack some day soon, so I thought I’d drag the kittens out of the burning house while I could. I backdated them so they are at the end, but here’s some permalinks if you want to read them:

- [The Rainer Buchty Ratio](http://notes.variogr.am/post/229233961/the-rainer-buchty-ratio-archive) \[oft-referenced mathematical model\]
- [Pushpin is Real](http://notes.variogr.am/post/229232511/pushpin-is-real-archive) \[true tales of failed but popular product\]
- [Armed Forces in Alphabetical Order](http://notes.variogr.am/post/225922016/armed-forces-in-alphabetical-order-archive) \[still angry about bad metadata\]
- [Prediction](http://notes.variogr.am/post/229234374/prediction-archive) \[…\]

More to come from the vaults…
